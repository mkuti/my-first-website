# My very first Web Page!

Hello

For first project, followed course video content and tried to copy the idea
Used Cloud9, Git and GitHub to write code and store it to make it public
Tried to push and store code to GitHub everytime I updated code in Cloud9 to get used to it and check its result
used images of languages logo from Google.com
downloaded MyImage plugin to access "view image" on google.com
